# Introduction to `git`
## Slides partially taken by Pasquale Africa and Konstantin Karchev
[Notes 1](https://github.com/pcafrica/hpc_for_data_science_2023-2024/blob/main/slides/01/01-intro.md) [Notes 2](https://github.com/pcafrica/hpc_for_data_science_2023-2024/blob/main/notes/01/01-2-git.md)

# Installation
[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

* **Linux** Typically in Linux systems is already installed, try `git --version`. If it's not installed you can do  `sudo apt install git-all`
* **macOS** Try `git --version` if not installed it will prompt you to install it.
* **Windows** find you executable on [https://git-scm.com/downloads/win](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)

---

#  Command Line vs GUI

There are several way to use `git`. 
 *  **Command Line** one can use it directly from the command line and all commands are available there. If you are not familiar with the command line it will take some time, but it has many advantadges. Look for  Terminal in macOS and Linux, and Command Prompt or PowerShell in Windows.
 * **GUI version** Graphical user interface versions are available everywhere online, you can choose one of those. They are not always complete, but they allow to a have a simpler and graphical interface.

# Version control
Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

`git` is a free and open-source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Unlike older centralized version control systems such as SVN and CVS, Git is distributed: every developer has the full history of their code repository locally. This makes the initial clone of the repository slower, but subsequent operations dramatically faster.

# How does `git` work?

1. Create (or find) a repository with a git hosting tool (an online platform that hosts you project, like [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/)).
2. `git clone` (download) the repository.
3. `git add` a file to your local repo.
4. `git commit` (save) the changes, this is a local action, the remote repository (the one in the cloud) is still unchanged.
5. `git push` your changes, this action synchronizes your version with the one in the hosting platform.

# How does `git` works? (Collaborative)

If you and your teammates work on different files the workflow is the same as before, you just have to remember to `pull` the changes that your colleagues made.

If you have to work on the same files, the best practice is to create a new `branch`, which is a particular version of the code that branches form the main one. After you have finished working on your feature you `merge` the branch into the main.

# Other useful `git` commands

- `git diff` shows the differences between your code and the last commit.
- `git status` lists the status of all the files (e.g. which files have been changed, which are new, which are deleted and which have been added).
- `git log` shows the history of commits.
- `git checkout` switches to a specific commit or branch and switch a specific file to the latest commit version.
- `git stash` temporarily hides all the modified tracked files.

# SSH authentication

![bg right:40% width:450px](images/01_rsa.png)

1. Sign up for a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
2. [Create a SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=linux).
3. [Add it to your account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).
4. Configure your machine:
```
git config --global user.name "Name Surname"
git config --global user.email "name.surname@email.com"
```

See [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-the-ssh-encryption-and-connection-process) for more details on SSH authentication.

<style scoped>section{font-size:23px;padding:50px;padding-top:50px}</style>

# Exercise: hands on `git`. Collaborative file management (1/3)
1. Form groups of 2-3 members.
2. Designate one member to create a new repository (visit https://github.com/ and click the `+` button in the top right corner), and ensure everyone clones it.
3. In a sequential manner, each group member should create a file with a distinct name and push it to the online repository while the remaining members pull the changes.
   ```
   git pull
   git add file_name
   git commit -m "Message describing what I did in this changes"
   git push
   ```
4. Repeat step 3, but this time, each participant should modify a different file than the ones modified by the other members of the group.

# Exercise: hands on `git`. Collaborative file management (2/3)
Now, let's work on the same file, `main.py`. Each person should create a hello world `main.py` that includes a personalized greeting with your name. To prevent conflicts, follow these steps:

1. Create a unique branch using the command: `git checkout -b [new_branch]`.
2. Develop your code and push your branch to the online repository.
3. Once everyone has finished their work, merge your branch into the `main` branch using the following commands:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge [new_branch]
git push origin main
```

# Exercise: hands on `git`. Collaborative file management (3/3)

## How to deal with `git` conflicts
The first person to complete this process will experience no issues. However, subsequent participants may encounter merge conflicts.

Git will mark the conflicting sections in the file. You'll see these sections surrounded by `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers.

Carefully review the conflicting sections and decide which changes to keep. Remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) and make the necessary adjustments to the code to integrate both sets of changes correctly.

After resolving the conflict, commit your changes and push your resolution to the repository.

# [Git](https://git-scm.com/): [the information manager from hell](https://git-scm.com/docs/git.html#_name)

[Git](https://youtu.be/7cqHtGb9WYM?t=80) is a version control system that can be used to track development progress on a project. Its utility ranges from pure curiosity (when and by whom certain code, etc. was created/edited), through collaboration (merging the simultaneous work of multiple authors) and disaster prevention and/or mitigation (code review, reverting, and patching), back to semantic information about the project (releases).

---

> [!NOTE]
> Git is easiest to use with a [graphical user interface](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) like [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) for VSCode, or [IntelliJ's Git integration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-git-integration.html). The latter is my favourite: I'm a way "better" gitter for it. Below, I'll describe the main Git operations without too much attention to command-line syntax, mainly for the benefit of terminology and the occasional simple use on a remote machine, assuming nobody would have one as their main development environment lest they be relying on a good IDE. The reader is encouraged to browse the documentation at [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/docs) and the numerous blog posts online that illustrate the concepts discussed here in more detail.

---

### Initting

To start "tracking a folder" (and the whole *worktree* within it) with Git, run
```shell
git init
```
in it. This won't do anything noticeable, except create a (hidden) `.git` directory. Alternatively, you can
```shell
git clone URL
```
a project that already exists online.

---
### Committing

The main operation in Git is
```shell
git commit -m "MESSAGE"
```
This will irreversibly[^force] record the state of the project[^stage] to the Git repository in a commit object, identified by a *hash*: a sensitive encoding of the commit's contents, which consist of the changed files, reference(s) to the parent commit(s), the author, time, and supplied `MESSAGE`. The hash is used as the "name" of the commit and can usually be uniquely shortened to the first eight or so characters.


[^force]: Nothing is irreversible, and commits can be overwritten, but this is strongly discouraged. We'll demonstrate this by the end of the lecture.

[^stage]: A detail that you shouldn't need to worry about if using a Git GUI (or at all, why does it even exist?! See the end of [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54812022/7185647).) is Git's *staging area* / *index*: an intermediary where files need to be `git add`ed before being commited. In a GUI, you can select which of the changed files—or even which edits within them—to add to a commit.

---
#### `HEAD`, branches, and other pointers

Commits, keeping references to their parent(s), form the *commit tree*: the source of all truth about the version history of a project. For convenience, Git also includes several "pointers" to commits. The most prominent one is `HEAD`, which simply refers to the "current" commit, which is usually the latest one created.[^detached]

On the other hand, *tags* are simple pointers intended to permanently refer to a given commit (i.e. state of the project) and are often used to denote milestones or releases.

---
`HEAD` (usually)[^detached] carries around with it the "current" *branch*: a fancy name for another kind of pointer-to-commit, intended to "spearhead" the growth of the commit tree in many simultaneous directions, *branching* out from the `main` development path. Coincidentally, the default branch in recent times is called `main` and usually represents a "presentable" version of the project. Meanwhile, developers should
```shell
git checkout
```
new branches to work on new features, bug fixes, etc. and then [merge](#merging) their work into the `main` branch (but see GitHub's pull requests, which allow code moderation (and editing) before changes are accepted/merged).

---
### Remotes

> [!NOTE]
> The remote and its branches are automatically set up when `git clone`ing it. But if you `git init`ted a new repo instead, you can still
> ```shell
> git remote add REMOTE_NAME REMOTE_URL
> ```
> later ("`origin`" is usually chosen for `REMOTE_NAME`).
>
> If your local branch has not yet been set to track a remote one, this can be stipulated by
> ```shell
> git branch --set-upstream-to=REMOTE_NAME/REMOTE_BRANCH LOCAL_BRANCH
> ```

---
Local branches can be associated with remote counterparts, and these can be synchronised by
```shell
git push
```
ing local changes to the remote repository and
```shell
git pull
```
ing changes from the remote. Note that these commands may often fail! if the commit trees have "diverged" (branched out inadvertently, e.g. if someone else has contributed to the remote). In that case, one needs to first
```shell
git fetch
```
the remote repository (remote copy of the commit tree) and then

[^detached]: `HEAD` *can* be made to point to older commits, in which case `git commit`ting again leads to the so-called ["detached HEAD" state](https://kodekloud.com/blog/git-detached-head/) (don't worry, it's not dangerous, if you know what you're doing)).

---
### Merging

```shell
git merge
```
is probably the most daunting of the Git operations. However, it's in essence simply a record that a commit "came from" multiple parents; but its contents are still the *final* result of the merge operation, i.e. the file(s) in their final state. While, in the past, merging files on the command line might have been a pain, modern GUI tools can help you compare the different input versions and effortlessly combine them.

## A visual cheatsheet
[Here](https://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html) you can find a very-well done visual cheatsheet showing the main git commands and the way they interact with the index, the workspace, the local repository, and more.

---
## Bonus: modifying commit history

In fact, the majority of mergers can be performed without `git merge`. An annoyingly common example is when someone pushes unrelated functionality to the upstream (remote) branch while you're working on your local copy, and now your push is rejected because you need to account for the new commits. Can't we simply "pretend" we started working *after* the other person pushed their changes? Yes! Yes, we can:
```shell
git rebase
```
Rebasing "moves" (reapplies) a collection of commits "on top of" a given point in the commit history, taking care to not repeat any changes that might already exist. Since this is getting into advanced territory, the reader is refered to [the excellent docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) and the in-class demonstration.

---
But what if you \*gasp\* make a mistake and *then commit it*?! Well, noticing your mistake is a good start, and you can always
```shell
git revert COMMIT
```
regardless of how long (how many commits) ago the mistake happened. However, this will actually make a new commit that explicitly undoes your mistake, making it doubly evident. What if you're ashamed and want to hide it, i.e. remove the offending commit from history and overwrite it with something which you hope is not a mistake?

If would like to edit the last commit, i.e. the one `HEAD` points to, you can do
```shell
git commit --fixup | --amend
```
---
There are versions that allow you to just edit the commit message or just the commit contents: check out [the docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---fixupamendrewordltcommitgt), [the other docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---amend), [this guide](https://jordanelver.co.uk/blog/2020/06/04/fixing-commits-with-git-commit-fixup-and-git-rebase-autosquash/), and your GUI!

In more complicated situations—when the commit to be modified already parented new changes—one can use the powerful
```shell
git rebase --interactive
```
to rewrite a series of commits. This will
1. Rewind time to the first commit to be edited, undoing (but still remembering) all newer changes in the worktree (files on disk).
2. Let you make new changes at that point in history and commit them (`--ammend`) on top of the existing commit.
3. Advance time by one commit, applying it on top of the newly edited files.
4. Pause again and goto 2. until the whole history is repeated (with possible modifications).

---
In the process of interactive `git rebase`ing, code conflicts might arise, which have to be resolved as if merging (but no merge commits will be made). In any case, GUIs make all this really easy, as we'll demonstrate in class.

Again, `git rebase` creates new commits, so if the old ones have already been pushed, conflicts will arise when pushing again. The civilised way of proceding is to `git merge` the (remote) old version of the branch and the edited one in a new commit, but what's the point of that?! Instead, if allowed by the remote branch protection rules, you can
```shell
git push --force
```
but this is not too collegeal (what if your collaborators already pulled your mistakes into their local repos?!). If you don't have colleagues though and know what you're doing, `git push --force` away!

---
## Bonus: (taking the) blame

What if it wasn't you who made the mistake?
```shell
git blame
```
can tell you who did (or, in general, which commit each fragment of code came from). This can also be useful when reviewing the code of libraries you use, which suddenly break, in order to find out when the breaking change was introduced and revert to a time before that. Again, GUIs and GitHub's online code browser can clearly annotate files with `git blame`.

# GitHub: where the world builds software[^motto]

[^motto]: Way better than their new motto "Let's build from here" but also, I guess, way more persecutable.

I suggest using [GitHub](https://github.com/) for all your remote Git need: it made $1 billion profit in 2022, so it must be good (it's completely free to use in ordinary circumstances).

Beyond *storing*[^GHforce] all the commits you've `git push`ed, GitHub can [visualise them](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/understanding-connections-between-repositories#viewing-a-repositorys-network) in all their interconnectedness, measure your [pulse](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/using-pulse-to-view-a-summary-of-repository-activity) (activity in software development), automatically deploy your repositories to continuous integration (see lecture on Testing) and documentation (see lecture on Documentation) tools, and help you interact with your users. That last part comes in two flavours: 

[^GHforce]: Here's a tip: by default, `git push --force`ing rewritten history is disabled for obvious reasons, but a GitHub repo owner/administrator can enable this on a per-branch basis from the repo's Setting → Branches → Add branch *protection* (lol) rule → Allow force pushes. Use this with caution.

---
### User feedback: GitHub issues and pull requests

#### Issues

GitHub allows *everyone* to express their issues with your code.[^democracy]

> [!NOTE]
> Not all "issues" are bad. For example, PyTorch has, [among others](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/new/choose), issue templates for a "Bug report" (bad) but also for a "Feature request" (demanding). 

GitHub's [Issues](https://github.com/features/issues) are full of features—e.g. labels, to-do lists, cross-references, templates—most of which are relevant only to large projects with numerous on-boarded developers. However, it won't hurt if you yourself use GitHub's issues to keep track of what's wrong and what can be improved in your software.  

[^democracy]: In fact, having and advertising a means for receiving user feedback is a [requirement](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#submission-requirements) for publishing papers about open source software in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/). Conversely, you can express *your* issues with anyone's public code! Use democracy [wisely](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/1277#issuecomment-667670005).

---
#### Pull requests

Sometimes a user (could be you) already has a solution in mind for some issue[^pull-issue] (e.g. how to fix a bug or implement a feature). In that case, they can ask politely that the owner/administrator of the repo incorporate their code into the software.

A pull request is just that: a request that a given branch (can be a temporary one created specificcally to work on a bug/feature) be `git pull`ed into the `main` branch. GitHub offers [many features](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) related to pull requests, e.g. the ability to comment on particular changes, accept them one by one and/or modify the implementation (by pushing further commits on the source branch (even interactively from the web interface itself)).

[^pull-issue]: The issue need not have been officially raised; but if it has been, it can be linked to a pull request and automatically resolved when the pull request is satisfied.

---
##### [Forks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork)

OK, but what if you want to contribute to a repository you don't own/administer: e.g. you implemented a fancy new CUDA kernel for a special function, and you want it included in PyTorch? In this case, you can [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the "upstream" repository, creating a "clone" (but not  really a `git clone`!) of the original repo that GitHub can help you [keep in sync](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) but is otherwise yours to modify in any way! You can develop on top of it, and when you're ready, create a pull request back to the original repo.

### User feedforward: Public Releases

The other mode of communication between developer and user base is for the developer to act on the issues and feature requests (and maybe add features on their own initiative), accept contributions by pulling pull requests, and finally release a new version of the software. To this, [we dedicate the whole next lecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliffhanger).
